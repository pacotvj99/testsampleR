This package provides functions to design stratified sampling schemes that allow drawing test sets that reduce the variance around performance estimates. In doing so, the package supports various allocations. Additionally, the package provides functions that estimates metrics with standard errors for test set drawn with simple random sampling and stratified sampling. Lastly, the package allows researchers to implement sample size calculations to decide how large a test set to draw to achieve a desired level of statistical precision. Detailed descriptions of the statistical method and derivations can be found in the accompanying paper.
